# VantaTest 🧪

An independent test copy of [VantaUI](https://github.com/MrRos3/VantaUI). Use this repository to experiment with components, themes, motion and styling without changing production VantaUI.

## Run the full UI laboratory

Execute in your Roblox client:

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrRos3/VantaTest/main/example.lua?v=" .. os.time()
))()
```

The LAB showcase creates a complete window. Loading the library by itself does **not** create a window.

## What's available?

| Tab | Interactive demos |

### Vanta Chat 3.0 — dedicated Vanta participants

The Chat tab now uses **dedicated VantaEN / VantaAR channels**, with explicit server admission. It never falls back to public Roblox server chat or default whispers. Its GUI and transport are separate modules. An owned-experience server is required; loading client code in an unrelated game does not create a Vanta network there.

Supported source includes authenticated Roblox identities, filtered send/receive, friend DMs between opted-in eligible members, timestamped replies, server-synchronized reaction counts, 150-item received session history, admission/message/reaction limits and cleanup leases. No fake conversations, online counts or delivery receipts are shown.

The warm charcoal/orange Pulse-inspired UI uses original **SaltyIcons PNGs**, including send, through the optional original-image resolver. `assets/salty-chat/` includes those exact files, hashes and licenses for native uploads. Platform-integrated mode uses Roblox's native channel window inside the Vanta shell.

**[Setup, architecture audit, blockers and test instructions](docs/roblox-chat-setup.md)**. The requested arbitrary cross-game network and persistent pre-join history remain outside this supported implementation; the report explains the exact boundary. The Render companion is tested and hardened separately, not used as an in-game relay.

**VantaUI production remains unchanged.**

All **18 element types currently registered** in the library are represented: Paragraph, Button, Toggle, Slider, ProgressBar, Keybind, Input, Dropdown, Code, Colorpicker, Section, Divider, Space, Image, Group, HStack, VStack, Viewport.

The Video element exists in the source tree but is deliberately **not registered** in the shipped library, so it is not included as an available control.

The lab shows component-construction failures in the executor console, and also includes a diagnostics button. Browser-previewing the source is not equivalent to a live Roblox client test.

## Import the library without a showcase window

```lua
local VantaTest = loadstring(game:HttpGet(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrRos3/VantaTest/main/main.lua?v=" .. os.time()
))()
-- Then call VantaTest:CreateWindow({ Title = "Your GUI" }) and add tabs.
```

The public loader and branding image URLs now use **MrRos3/VantaTest**. All changes here stay independent of production VantaUI.

## Style baseline

- Salty Special, AMOLED-first black and red
- Solid OLED-black lower-right notifications
- Full-height burgundy timeout overlay matching the Close Window button (#251016)
- **High-definition Crimson01 wallpaper** uses the original 1671×941 anime artwork, not an enlarged GIF frame
  - The character, hair and flowers remain completely stable and sharp
  - Native red petals and embers drift smoothly above the wallpaper without frame swaps
  - No 224×126 atlas upscaling, cropped duplicate faces or background shaking
  - The official VantaTest loader enables the animation automatically while respecting custom backgrounds
  - Cached full-resolution artwork is downloaded through existing custom-image support
- Rounded components with the compact three-dot window topbar
- Optional themes: Smoked, Dark, AMOLED and Violet
- v0.3.8 runtime; changes to `src/` trigger the GitHub build workflow for `dist/main.lua`
